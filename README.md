# BasketballSeasonPredictor
#### This project was built using Python and many of it's libraries. Using a public dataset of historical college basketball playoff performance, I trained a machine learning algorithm to utilize within the final web application. I analyzed the data, graphed the data, and developed the trained prediction model in a Jupyter Notebook. I built a dashboard that allows the user to input their team's performance data and run it through the trained prediction model. The user inputs are ran through the trained prediciton model and the program produces the output of either the team "making the playoffs" or "not making the playoffs".
