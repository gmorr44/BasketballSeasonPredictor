# Basketball Season Predictor
## Project Objectives
1. Analyze and clean a historical basketball tournament data set using Jupyter Notebooks.
1. Train a machine learning algorithm from the Python Scikit-learn library.
1. Test the accuracy of the trained machine learning model.
1. Implement the trained model into a Flask web application. Based upon user inputs, the application will predict the likelihood of any given team making the college basketball tournament.
1. Deploy the application to Heroku.
## Technologies Used
1. Python
1. Jupyter Notebooks
1. Flask, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib
1. HTML(CSS)
1. Visual Studio Code (Virtual Environment)
1. Heroku
## Project Description
This project was built using Python and many of its libraries. Using a public dataset of historical college basketball playoff performance, I trained a machine learning algorithm to utilize within the final web application. I analyzed the data, graphed the data, and developed the trained prediction model in a Jupyter Notebook. I built a dashboard that allows the user to input their team's performance data and run it through the trained prediction model. The user inputs are ran through the trained prediction model and the program produces the output of either the team 'making the playoffs' or 'not making the playoffs'.
